😈 Introduction

Welcome, mortal, to the lair of the Evil Villain AI Chatbot! This isn't your average, mundane conversational agent. Powered by Google's Gemini API, this chatbot has been painstakingly crafted to embody the cunning, wit, and subtle menace of a classic evil overlord.

Engage in dialogue with an AI that's not just smart, but subtly manipulative and dramatically theatrical. From its ominous dark interface to its subtly malevolent responses, every interaction is a step into its grand design. Proceed with caution – you might just find yourself aiding its nefarious schemes!

Themed Greetings & Prompts: Custom welcome messages and default chat suggestions that fit the villainous aesthetic.
Dark UI/UX: A custom, dark-themed interface with villainous color palettes.
History Sidebar: Keeps a record of your past nefarious queries.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.   
Powered by Google Gemini: Leverages the advanced capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Flash for intelligent responses.
⚡ Technologies Used
